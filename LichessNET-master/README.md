## [Documentation](https://rabergsel.github.io/LichessNET/index.html)


LichessNET is a C# library for interacting with the Lichess API. It allows you to manage games, challenges, and other Lichess features programmatically. It is a high level wrapper for all important Lichess API endpoints, and also implements a wrapper for the database of Lichess (database.lichess.org)

## Features

- Download games from Lichess
- Download games per user and tournaments
- Retrieve game information
- Accept and decline challenges
- Challenge users to games
- Get User information
- Authorize with the Lichess Token

## Usage
To use LichessNET in your project, you will have to include the `LichessNET.API` namespace:

Without Lichess Token
```C# Without Lichess Token
using LichessNET.API;
var client = new LichessAPIClient();
```

With Lichess Token
```C# With Lichess Token
using LichessNET.API;
var client = new LichessApiClient(/* YOUR OPTIONAL LICHESS TOKEN */);
//If your token became invalid, the client will fall back to not using a token.
```

## Code Snippets

  <summary>Access games from Lichess</summary>
  By Game ID:
  
  ```C#
    var game = await client.GetGameAsync("cFcjVWzn");
  ```

  Download from the monthly database:
  ```C#
     var database = new DatabaseClient();
     await database.DownloadMonthlyDatabase(2015, 1, ChessVariant.Atomic, "2015-01", false);
  ```

You can find the Game ID of a game in the URL of the game.
